Previous studies revealed that nurses manifest negative mental health outcomes exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) of nurses in the Philippines and their workplace psychosocial support interventions during the pandemic. The ProQOL measures compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO), and secondary traumatic stress (STS).\nMETHODS: A self-administered online questionnaire was disseminated by the Philippine Nurses Association, Inc. to affiliated nurses via email and Facebook posts. Out of 713 responses, 239 were eligible with their data analyzed using t-test, one-way ANOVA, and post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons.\nRESULTS: Respondents were found to have high CS (41.95 [SD 5.97]), moderate BO (23.56 [SD 6.07]), and moderate STS (26.62 [SD 8.18]). The most reported intervention was policies on confidentiality of workers' mental health (84.94%) while the least reported was community engagements under the hospital's mental health program (61.51%). ProQOL scores significantly differed in CS by age (p=0.011), position (p=0.044) and monthly income (p=0.016), BO by age (p=0.001) and years with current employer (p=0.009), and STS by region (p=0.017) and area of assignment (p=0.015). The existence of interventions yielded significant increase in CS and decrease in BO scores.\nCONCLUSION: Nurses in the Philippines exhibit high and favorable ProQOL during the pandemic. The majority of respondents reported the presence of workplace interventions which yield significant differences in CS and BO. The findings highlight the importance of workplace psychosocial support interventions and the need to strengthen implementation.", 'keywords': ['COVID-19 pandemic', 'nurses', 'occupational health', 'psychosocial intervention', 'quality of life'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40308794'}, {'title': 'Occupational differences in COVID-19 hospital admission and mortality risks between women and men in Scotland: a population-based study using linked administrative data.', 'abstract': 'OBJECTIVES: Occupations vary with respect to workplace factors that influence exposure to COVID-19, such as ventilation, social contacts and protective equipment. Variations between women and men may arise because they have different occupational roles or behavioural responses. We estimated occupational differences in COVID-19 hospital admission and mortality risks by sex.\nMETHODS: We combined (1) individual-level data from 2011 Census with (2) health records and (3) household-level information from residential identifiers, using a Scottish cohort of 1.7\u2009million adults aged 40-64 years between 1 March 2020 and 31 January 2021. We estimated age-standardised COVID-19 hospital admission and mortality rates, stratified by sex and occupation. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for pre-pandemic health and occupational exposure factors, including interaction effects between occupation and sex.\nRESULTS: Women had lower age-standardised COVID-19 hospital admission and mortality rates than men. Among women, adjusted death risks were lowest for health professionals, and those in associate professional and technical occupations (paramedics and medical technicians), with the latter supported by results from the interaction model. Among men, elevated adjusted admission and death risks were observed for large vehicle and taxi drivers. Additionally, admission risks remained high among men in caring personal services (including home and care workers), while elevated risks were observed among women in customer service occupations (call centre operators) and process, plant and machine operative roles (assemblers and sorters).\nCONCLUSIONS: Occupational differences in COVID-19 hospital admission and mortality risks between women and men highlight the need to account for sex differences when developing interventions to reduce infections among vulnerable occupational groups.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'Mortality', 'Occupational Groups', 'Occupational Health', 'Public health'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40306899'}, {'title': 'Examining the advantages and disadvantages of working from home from the perspectives of employees following the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'abstract': 'Background: Working from home (WFH) has become more popular and has spread rapidly around the world. This became especially noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic because most individuals had to work from home if they were not key workers (e.g., healthcare and public safety workers). However, further research is needed on the possible consequences of WFH, particularly in terms of benefits and challenges. Objective: The present study aimed to examine the advantages and disadvantages of WFH from an employee perspective. Methods: Two simple questions were asked to white-collar Turkish employees (N\u2009=\u2009613) who experienced WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic: "What do you think are the advantages of working from home?" and "What do you think are the disadvantages of working from home?". The answers to the questions were then content analyzed. Results: The key advantages identified were protection from COVID-19, saving time, better focus on work, more time for self-improvement, reduced personal expenses, and reduced social pressure. The key disadvantages included increased work-family conflict, alienation from work, non-ergonomic working conditions, technostress, miscommunication, social isolation, increased workload, inefficiency, and depression. Conclusions: The results indicate that although WFH has many advantages for employees, it also has many disadvantages that need to be carefully considered by both organizations and employees.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'occupational health', 'pandemics', 'qualitative research', 'teleworking', 'work-life balance', 'workplace'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40296776'}, {'title': 'Association of workplace infection control and perceived organizational support on worker loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'abstract': "OBJECTIVE: Research has not fully determined the impact of the infection control practices adopted in workplaces during the COVID-19 pandemic on employees' feelings of loneliness. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between these control measures and employees' loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their relationship with perceived organizational support (POS).\nMETHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted via an internet-based questionnaire. Of the 27,036 responses, data from 10,562 were analyzed. Workplace infection control practices were divided into four groups based on the number of practices adopted by participants. The odds ratios (ORs) of loneliness associated with each workplace infection control practice were calculated using multilevel logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: Among the participants, 22.1, 23.6, 22.2, and 32.1% worked at companies that implemented 0-2, 3-5, 6-7, and 8 or more infection control practices, respectively. Loneliness was reported by 6.3% of the participants. After adjustments for sex and age, the OR of the group with the fewest infection control practices was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.54-2.37, p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001) compared with the group with the most practices adopted.

Comparative studies of the fitted filtration efficiency of different types of masks are scarce.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the fitted filtration efficiency against small aerosols (0.02-1 µm) of medical and non-medical masks and respirators when worn, and how this is affected by user modifications (hacks) and by overmasking with a cloth mask.\nDESIGN: We tested a 2-layer woven-cotton cloth mask of a consensus design, ASTM-certified level 1 and level 3 masks, a non-certified mask, KF94s, KN95s, an N95 and a CaN99.\nSETTING: Closed rooms with ambient particles supplemented by salt particles.\nPARTICIPANTS: 12 total participants; 21-55 years, 68% female, 77% white, NIOSH 1-10.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Using standard methods and a PortaCount 8038, we counted 0.02-1 µm particles inside and outside masks and respirators, expressing results as the percentage filtered by each mask. We also studied level 1 and level 3 masks with earguards, scrub caps, the knot-and-tuck method, and the effects of braces or overmasking with a cloth mask.\nRESULTS: Filtration efficiency for the cloth mask was 47-55%, for level 1 masks 52-60%, for level 3 masks 60-77%. A non-certified KN95 look-alike, two KF94s, and three KN95s filtered 57-77%, and the N95 and CaN99 97-98% without fit testing. External braces and overmasking with a well-fitting cloth mask increased filtration, but earguards, scrub caps, and the knot-and-tuck method did not.\nLIMITATIONS: Limited number of masks of each type sampled; no adjustment for multiple comparisons.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Well-fitting 2-layer cotton masks filter in the same range as level 1 masks when worn: around 50%. Level 3 masks and KN95s/KF94s filter around 70%. Over a level 1 mask, external braces or overmasking with a cloth-mask-on-ties produced filtration around 90%. Only N95s and CaN99s, both of which have overhead elastic, performed close to the occupational health and safety standards for fit tested PPE (>99%), filtering at 97-99% when worn, without formal fit testing.

This study aimed to assess social inequalities in changes in the labour market as well as job dissatisfaction among workers in the city of Barcelona between 2016 and 2022. A comparison of two population-based cross-sectional studies was carried out, using data from the Barcelona Health Surveys (BHS) of 2016-17 and 2021-22. Data sampling was weighted to ensure representativeness. A descriptive analysis was carried out for sociodemographic and work-related variables and multivariate weighted linear regressions were adjusted by potential confounders between year of the sample and job dissatisfaction. Job status improved and job dissatisfaction decreased in both sexes between 2016 and 2022. Having a non-manual job entailed a decrease in job dissatisfaction for women and men (-0.09; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.03 and -0.10; -0.16 to -0.04 respectively). Among women born outside Spain, job dissatisfaction increased (0.09; 0.02 to 0.16). Job dissatisfaction decreased among men with a full-time contract (-0.11; -0.21 to -0.02). In both sexes, having no contract was associated with an increase in job dissatisfaction. There were improvements in the labour market of Barcelona.

A large body of evidence has shown that poor working conditions can lead to low levels of job satisfaction, increased emotional stress and burnout. While symptom targeted interventions take effect after symptoms become manifest, preventive interventions are required to reduce the risk of work-related diseases. Therefore, the UPGRADE-trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Creative Strengthening Groups as a potential intervention to enhance job satisfaction and work-related health. The German Innovation Fund (Innovationsfonds) funded the project.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial and randomly assigned healthcare professionals to either the intervention or the control group. The intervention - Creative Strengthening Groups - consisted of two one-day classes. We evaluated the primary outcome job satisfaction and further work-related outcomes using standardized questionnaires. We collected data at baseline as well as after three and six months. The study was conducted between October 2019 to March 2023, including the pandemic period.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 196 participants (intervention n\u2009=\u200988, control n\u2009=\u2009108) with a mean age of 46.2\u2009±\u200912.1 years (84.5% female). 43.7% were nursing professionals. Job satisfaction in the intervention group increased from 55.47\u2009±\u200910.23 to 57.07\u2009±\u200911.65 after three months and decreased in the control group from 56.29\u2009±\u200919.69 to 53.47\u2009±\u200920.09. The difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, change in patient-related stress significantly differed between groups (intervention: -3.9\u2009±\u200912.16 vs. control: 5.17\u2009±\u200917.43; p\u2009=.027) as well as personal burnout (intervention: -5.25\u2009±\u200913.1 vs. control: 4.35\u2009±\u200916.24; p\u2009=.011). Within the intervention group, we observed a greater improvement concerning work-related burnout in nursing staff in geriatric care than in hospitals (-15.27\u2009±\u200913.5 vs. +3.28\u2009±\u200913.7; p\u2009=.003).\nCONCLUSION: Though the Covid-19 pandemic worsened working conditions for healthcare professionals, our results indicate that intervention has the potential to enhance job satisfaction and work related health. Notably, due to the overall workload and the pandemic restrictions, a high number of participants did not continually participate in both classes of the intervention and some did not return all questionnaires. As long as healthcare professionals in Germany are facing exceedingly bad working conditions, it is very difficult to support their resources such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, and optimism by health promotion interventions.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS; ID: DRKS00020908).
